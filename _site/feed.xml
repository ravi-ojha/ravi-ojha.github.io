        <title>Hobbyist Competitive Programmer to Software Developer at HackerEarth</title>
        <description>During four years of Computer Engineering, I used to think about what I should pursue as professional career. Loved designing graphic posters, thoroughly enjoyed Competitive Programmer and it was immensely satisfying to build software products to solve real world problems. So much dilemma and I ended up being a Software Engineer at HackerEarth</description>

        <title>Greatest Common Divisor of a list of numbers - C++ and Python Implementation</title>
        <description>First, we will see how to find GCD of two numbers. It is also known as Highest Common Factor - HCF. Then we will move on to find the GCD of a list of numbers and code it in both C++ as well as Python</description>

        <title>Fast Power Algorithm - Exponentiation by Squaring - C++ and Python Implementation</title>
        <description>We know how to find 2 raised to the power 10. But what if we have to find 2 raised to the power very large number such as 1000000000? We discuss how to find solution to such a problem using an fast, efficient algorithm</description>

        <title>Collection of Python posts for beginners</title>
        <description>I took MITx 6.00x on edX in 2012 and we were taught basics of Python along-with programming in general. While revisiting the videos in the end, I thought of creating a quick guide for myself and everyone else.</description>
