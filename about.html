  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Ravi Ojha, responsible for just about everything on this site. That's me, over to the right.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started Rookie's Lab in 2012 as a freshman in college to rant about extra-curricular activities. It also serves as an excuse to practice the art of writing. I started with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _my_tags/design.md %}">graphic designs</a>. Then I became a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _my_tags/competitive-programming.md %}">competitive programming</a> fanatic. Later, I got introduced to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _my_tags/python.md %}">python</a> in an online course offered by MIT. After graduation, I started writing about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _my_tags/software-engineering.md %}">software engineering</a> because that's what I ended up doing for a living. As to the part of practicing the art of writing, it's been a mild success so far, however, I shy away in embarrassment when I read my earlier posts. Maybe, that's a measure of progress. And, from the quote above, I believe writing will help me generate more ideas, other than communicating with the audience.

  <h2>"Rookie's Lab"?</h2>
  <p>
    I used to watch Dexter's Lab (I still do sometimes) and wanted to name <i>"&lt;something&gt; lab"</i>. Back in 2012, I was a privacy freak and didn't like the idea of disclosing the man behind the blog. So using my name was not an option. Now, I was just a new kid in the world of blogging, a novice. Looked up "novice" on <a href="http://www.thesaurus.com/">thesaurus</a> for other words and hence "Rookie's Lab".
