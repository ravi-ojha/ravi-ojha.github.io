        <title>A millennial&apos;s thoughts on embarking as a Software Engineer</title>
        <description>We, the new generation of software engineers, love to talk about creating an impact. We attend overnight hackathons to build the next big thing. Good that we can build an app in 24 hours, but is it really a production ready codebase? Are we carried away with the agility brought in by our generation?</description>

        <title>Extended Euclid Algorithm to find GCD and Bézout&apos;s coefficients</title>
        <description>We will see how to use Extended Euclid&apos;s Algorithm to find GCD of two numbers. It also gives us Bézout&apos;s coefficients (x, y) such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). We will discuss and implement all of the above problems in Python and C++</description>
