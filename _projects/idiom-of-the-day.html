    <h2> WHY? </h2>
    <p> The idea hit me while I was reading The Martian by Andy Weir. Rich Purnell, a character in the book, is portrayed as an autistic person, having difficulty in understanding the meaning of the abstract concepts of the language. So here goes, a chrome extension that would help me and the likes of Rich Purnell become better at such play of words. Concept is to show one idiom per day, so that it gets hard-wired in our memory.</p>

    <p> Concept is to show one idiom per day. So that it gets hard-wired in our memory. The data is stored in browser local storage for the day, after the first network call. Also, in the first network call, it fetches data from memcache. Everyone in the world will see only one particular idiom on a given day. You get it right? If the memcache hit misses, then I read from database and set it in memcache for 48 hours (24 + 24 buffer for the entire world clock). </p>
